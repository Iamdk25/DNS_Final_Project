# Final Project  -  Parking & Offense Management System 

Submitted by: **Sujith Palanivasagam, Ninad Deshpande, Divyarajsinh Karmariya**

**Parking & Offense Management System** is a project to manage, and keep track of all the final parking citation appeals that come to the USF Student Government Supreme Court. The USF Student Government Supreme Court deals with all final appeals for on-campus parking citations for students from PATS (Parking And Transportation Services). Currently, they do not have a method of looking through past offenders' lists and determining if a student has been in front of them before or not. Since one of our team members works in the department, we have used his experience to realistically create a program that will be used in real life from next semester...most probably after a few more updates to the program's functionality. This project aims to solve this problem by creating a system to manage all this data efficiently, using concepts that we learned from our Data Structures class.


## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can Insert Offense and Offender information while answering prompts from the system.
- [ ] User can Search up a violator or offendor using their U Number.
- [ ] All the information the the user provides is stored in a csv database and is sorted using Insertion Sort.
- [ ] Priority Queues have been implemented to find the top 3 highest parking or road offenses commited by a person.
- [ ] Vector has been implemented to filter offenses based on the age range of the offenders.


## Instructions to run the code
- [ ] Use * g++ main.cpp -o main * to run the file.
- [ ] A main.exe file will be generated which will access the csv file.
- [ ] There must be atleast 1 blank csv(offense_data.csv) present in the same folder as the main file.
- [ ] A prompt will ask the user to select the operation one wants to perform with the Automated Offense Tracking System
- [ ] You can Add data, Search data, Display the top 3 offenses, Filter offenses based on age range and exit the code
 

## Thank you
